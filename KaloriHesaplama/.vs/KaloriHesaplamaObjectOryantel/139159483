The error message indicates that the context instance was resolved from dependency injection and then later disposed of, but the same context instance was used elsewhere in the application. This error can occur if you are calling \u0027Dispose\u0027 on the context instance, or wrapping it in a using statement. \r\n\r\nThis might be happening because the \u0060context\u0060 variable is being disposed of before it is used in the \u0060btnYeniYemekEkle_Click\u0060 method. The \u0060using\u0060 statement is disposing of the \u0060context\u0060 variable before the \u0060yemekler\u0060 variable is assigned a value.

This will ensure that the \u0060context\u0060 variable is not disposed of before it is used. \r\n\r\nAnother way to fix this error is to move the \u0060using\u0060 statement that disposes of the \u0060context\u0060 variable inside the \u0060for\u0060 loop. This will ensure that a new instance of the \u0060KaloriHesaplamaDbContext\u0060 class is created for each iteration of the loop, and the \u0060context\u0060 variable is not disposed of prematurely. \r\n\r\nIf these solutions do not work, you may need to provide additional information, such as the code for the \u0060KaloriHesaplamaDbContext\u0060 class and any other relevant code that might be contributing to the error.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["Can you explain what dependency injection is?","Can you provide an example of how to create a new instance of the KaloriHesaplamaDbContext class?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"ExplainException","LoggedSkillInvocations":null}
